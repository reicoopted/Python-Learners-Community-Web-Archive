# Python-Learners-Community-Web-Archive
A web archive collection dedicated to collecting and preserving questions, answers, and topics asked by and related to Beginner Python Programmers.

## What is this?
An archive created specifically to preserve questions, answers, and community resources for Beginner Python coders. Using Archive-It, we have archived websites like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Quora to show the history and culture of online coding help.

## Why did we do this?
We chose to archive these websites mainly for a class project. But all of us on the team at one point another looked to one, if not all, of these websites for help in our coding learning careers, and we felt that this web collection would be a great way to honor the work that everyone online does to help one another. 

## What did we archive?
We archived questions, help pages, and tagged answers on topics determined by our team to be beginner python concepts.

## Why should I look at this?
Over time, viewers will be able to see how the python language evolves, and how help centered on the language changes with that.
